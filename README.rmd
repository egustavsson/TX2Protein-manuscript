# TX2Protein - Transcript to protein

## Background

This repository contains the code used for the analysis in the manuscript *Protein isoform detection from long-read RNA-seq data*. This manuscript describes our software [NAME OF SOFTWARE], a simplified method for intergating protein coding potential of full-length transcript structures in mass spectrometry data. [NAME OF SOFTWARE] only requires a `GTF/GFF` file and the raw proteomic dataset, typically from The ProteomeXchange Consortium, and uses [`MetaMorpheus`](https://github.com/smith-chem-wisc/MetaMorpheus) for protein identifications. 


## Data

The data used in the

###


These analyses were performed using publicly available long-read RNA seq data, consisting of PacBio IsoSeq from 9 frontal cortex samples.
  
### ENCODE long-read data
This consists of publicly available frontal cortex samples from [ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/rna-seq/long-read-rna-seq/). All samples were sequenced on the PacBio Sequel II platform and processed with the ENCODE DCC deployment of the [TALON pipeline](https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/long-read-rna-pipeline). We downloaded the TSV and GTF files from the following samples:

```
# first give the execute permission to the script:
chmod +x 00a_download_ENCODE_files.sh

# then run it:
./00a_download_ENCODE_files.sh /path/to/directory/
```
